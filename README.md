# Castle-Scene
This scene contains a castle in a forest. I included terrain to make mountains and the castle itself. The terrain is decorated with several kinds of trees, grass, rocks, and bushes. There is a footman character with a spear who is the main character of this scene. The player can control the footman to walk and look around. I like fantasy and medieval scenes, so I thought of making a castle. However I was not inspired by any work in particular.
